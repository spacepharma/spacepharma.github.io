COURGENAY, Switzerland – Officials with SpacePharma SA, a world leader in providing simplified, high-value microgravity services, today issued the following statement regarding its orbiting nanosatellite, DIDO, which was one of 104 satellites launched on Feb. 15 aboard Indian Space Research Organization’s PSLV-C37 rocket:
 
“Today, we established a successful communications link with DIDO, SpacePharma’s nanosatellite equipped with mGnify, our proprietary miniaturized, end-to-end laboratory that allows researchers to remotely control vital scientific experiments anywhere from Earth,” said Yossi Yamin, founder of SpacePharma SA. “Everything on board DIDO appears to be working properly. We look forward to fully activating mGnify in the coming weeks and launching a suite of scientific experiments for our research customers.
