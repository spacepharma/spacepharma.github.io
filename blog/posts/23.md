The 13th Ilan Ramon International Space Conference will take place on January 28th and 30th at Tel Aviv University. This event is even bigger than prior years due to an exciting collaboration between the Israel Space Agency at the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Yuval Ne’eman Workshop for Science, Technology and Security. This year’s conference provides interaction with international prominent leaders in the space field, the Israeli space community, military personalities, and more. Speakers range from astronauts to directors of international research centers, including Mr. Yossi Yamin.
