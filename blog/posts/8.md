We have liftoff!

In the days following the launch, the satellite will pass over our ground station in Switzerland and is expected to start reporting vital bits of information, such as power levels and temperature.
Scientific experiments will be performed in the next phase of operations (within a few weeks), after testing the health of the different satellite sub-systems.
